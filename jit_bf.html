	<h2>Brainf*ck JIT Compiler in around 155 Lines with GNU C</h2>
	By Matthew Plant
      </div>
	  <p>
		In my last <a href="jit.html">post</a> I illustrated how JIT
		compilation can be achieved using GNU C with very little assembler (in
		that case, only one line). However, although I just claimed the
		contrary, it didn't really give an example JIT compilation, only JIT
		loading. Here I finally rectify that by providing an extremely
		unpolished Brainfuck compiler, using the previously illustrated methods.
		A few things to note about the example, before I dive into (and barely
		explain anything):
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>
		  Because I didn't want to deal with reallocating and whatnot, the
		  program just allocates and anonymous mapping of some sort of random
		  size (MAX_PROG_SIZE).
		</li>
		<li>
		  Because I didn't want to do relative jumps, I just set the desired
		  jump address to &#37;EAX and used a register-indirect jump. This means
		  that the code could definitely simplified a whole lot, but it made my
		  life a lot easier.
		</li>
		<li>
		  The code I used to test this was the default hello world program
		  supplied by Wikipedia and this
		  <a href="http://esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/bf-source/prog/mandelbrot.b">snazzy Mandelbrot viewer.</a>
		</li>
		<li>
		  The code only works on 32 bit systems as the size of an integer in GCC
		  on any system is 32 bits long.
		</li>
		<li>
		  If you want to see the entire program, including test cases (of which
		  there are only two), a
		  <a href="https://github.com/rookieMP/BF-JIT">GitHub repo is available here.</a>
		</li>

<p>
I'm not going to go in to much detail on how exactly this works, as all of the mechanics are noted in my previous blog. However, there is one part worth explaining, that is what happens when we get to a closing bracket ']'. Whenever we get to a place where we need to jump, we write out the instructions to jump to some random location. In this case, that location is 0xDEADDAD5. This is because we don't know where exactly we are to jump yet. Then, when we do figure out, we find the location of memory where we load 0xDEADDAD5 into &#37;EAX and change that value to the correct address. Sound confusing? Yeah I can't really explain it well. Sorry about that.

Anyway, I hope you found this interesting. I sort of did?
