	<h2>Writing a Simple Garbage Collector in C</h2>
	By Matthew Plant
      </div>
<p>People seem to think that writing a garbage collector is really hard, a deep
magic understood by a few great sages and
<a href="http://hboehm.info/gc/index.html">Hans Boehm (et al)</a>.
Well it's not. In fact, it's rather straight forward. I claim that the hardest
part in writing a GC is writing the memory allocator, which is as hard to write
as it is to look up the malloc example in K&amp;R.</p>

<p>A few important things to note before we begin. First, our code will be
dependent on the Linux kernel. Not GNU/Linux, but the Linux kernel. Secondly,
our code will be 32-bit and not one bit more. Thirdly. Please don't use this
code. I did not intend for it to be wholly correct and there may be subtle bugs
I did not catch. Regardless, the ideas themselves are still correct. Now, let's
get started.</p>

<p>If you see any inaccuracies, please email me at map@maplant.com
</p>

<h3>Making the Malloc:</h3>
<p>To begin, we need to write a memory allocator, or as we will be calling it,
a malloc function. The simplest malloc implementations maintain a linked-list of
free blocks of memory that can be partitioned and given out as needed. When a
user requests a chunk of memory, a block of the right size is removed from the
free list and returned. If no blocks of the right size exist, either a block of
a larger size is partitioned into smaller blocks or more memory is requested
from the kernel. Freeing a chunk of memory simply adds it back to the free list.
</p>

<p>Each chunk of memory in the free list begins with a header describing the
block. Our header will contain two fields, one indicating the size of the chunk
and the second pointing to the next free block of memory:</p>

<pre>typedef struct header {
    unsigned int    size;
    struct block    *next;
} header_t;
</pre>

<p>Using headers that are embedded in the memory we allocate is really the only
sensible way of doing this, but it has the added benefit of automatically
word-aligning the chunks, which is important.</p>

<p>Because we will need to keep track of the blocks of memory currently in use
as well as the blocks that are not, we will have a used list in addition to a
free list. Items will be added to the used list when they are removed from the
free list, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>We are almost ready to complete the first step and write our malloc
implementation. Before we do that, we first need to understand how to request
memory from the kernel.</p>

<p>Dynamically allocated memory resides in the so-called heap, a section memory
between the stack and the BSS (uninitialized data segment - all your global
variables that have the default value of zero). The heap starts at a low address
bordering the BSS and ends at the program break, which resides somewhere between
the BSS and the stack. Attempting to access any memory between the stack and the
break will cause an access violation (unless you access within the amount the
stack can be extended by, but that's a whole separate conversation). In order to
obtain more memory from the kernel, we simply extend the break, thus allowing us
to access more memory. To do this, we call the Unix sbrk system call, which
extends the break by its argument and returns the address of the previous break
on success, thus giving the program more memory. On failure, sbrk returns -1
casted to a void pointer, which is a terrible convention that no one likes.</p>

<p>We can use this knowledge to create two functions: morecore and
add_to_free_list. In the case theta we are out of blocks in the free list, we 
will call morecore to request more memory. Since requesting the kernel for more
memory is expensive, we will do it in page-size chunks. Knowing what a page is
is not important right now, but a terse explanation is that it is the smallest
unit of virtual memory that can be mapped to any particular location in physical
memory. We will use the function add_to_free_list to do exactly what it sounds
like.</p>

<pre>/*
 * Scan the free list and look for a place to put the block. Basically, we're
 * looking for any block the to be freed block might have been partitioned from.
 */
static void
add_to_free_list(header_t *bp)
{
    header_t *p;

    for (p = freep; !(bp &gt; p &amp;&amp; bp &lt; p-&gt;next); p = p-&gt;next)
        if (p &gt;= p-&gt;next &amp;&amp; (bp &gt; p || bp &lt; p-&gt;next))
            break;

    if (bp + bp-&gt;size == p-&gt;next) {
        bp-&gt;size += p-&gt;next-&gt;size;
        bp-&gt;next = p-&gt;next-&gt;next;
    } else
        bp-&gt;next = p-&gt;next;

    if (p + p-&gt;size == bp) {
        p-&gt;size += bp-&gt;size;
        p-&gt;next = bp-&gt;next;
    } else
        p-&gt;next = bp;

    freep = p;
}

#define MIN_ALLOC_SIZE 4096	/* We allocate blocks in page sized chunks. */

/*
 * Request more memory from the kernel.
 */
static header_t *
morecore(size_t num_units)
{
    void *vp;
    header_t *up;

    if (num_units &lt; MIN_ALLOC_SIZE)
        num_units = MIN_ALLOC_SIZE / sizeof(header_t);

    if ((vp = sbrk(num_units * sizeof(header_t))) == (void *) -1)
        return NULL;
		    
    up = (header_t *) vp;
    up-&gt;size = num_units;
    add_to_free_list (up);
    return freep;
}
</pre>

<p>Now that we have our two helper functions, writing our malloc function is
pretty straight forward. We simply scan the free list and use the first block
that is at least as big as the chunk we're trying to find. Because we use the 
first block we find instead of trying to find a "better" block, this algorithm
is known as first fit.</p>

<p>A quick note to clarify: the size field in the header struct is measured in
header-sized blocks, and not bytes.</p>

<pre>static header_t base; /* Zero sized block to get us started. */
static header_t *usedp, *freep;

/*
 * Find a chunk from the free list and put it in the used list.
 */
void *
GC_malloc(size_t alloc_size)
{
    size_t num_units;
    header_t *p, *prevp;

    num_units = (alloc_size + sizeof(header_t) - 1) / sizeof(header_t) + 1;  
    prevp = freep;

    for (p = prevp-&gt;next;; prevp = p, p = p-&gt;next) {
        if (p-&gt;size &gt;= num_units) { /* Big enough. */
            if (p-&gt;size == num_units) /* Exact size. */
                prevp-&gt;next = p-&gt;next;
            else {
                p-&gt;size -= num_units;
                p += p-&gt;size;
                p-&gt;size = num_units;
            }

            freep = prevp;
			
            /* Add to p to the used list. */
            if (usedp == NULL)	
                usedp = p-&gt;next = p;
            else {
                p-&gt;next = usedp-&gt;next;
                usedp-&gt;next = p;
            }

            return (void *) (p + 1);
        }
        if (p == freep) { /* Not enough memory. */
            p = morecore(num_units);
            if (p == NULL) /* Request for more memory failed. */
                return NULL;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Note that the success of this function depends on when we first use it that
freep = &amp;base. We'll make sure this is the case in our init function.</p>

<p>Although this code isn't going to win any awards for low fragmentation, it'll
work. And if it works, that means we can finally get to the fun part - the
garbage collection!</p>

<h3>Mark and Sweep:</h3>

<p>We did say that the garbage collector was going to be simple, so we will be
using the simplest algorithm possible: stop the world naive mark and sweep. This
algorithm works in two parts:</p>

<p>First, we scan all the blocks of memory that could possibly point to heap
data and see if any do. To do this, for each word-size chunk in the memory we're
looking at, we look at each block in the used list. If the word-sized chunk's
value is within the range of a used block, we mark the block.</p>

<p>Next, after all possible memory locations have been searched, we go through
the used list and add to the free list all blocks that haven't been marked.</p>

<p>Many people (or at least I did) get tripped up into thinking that garbage 
collection is impossible in C because by writing a simple function like malloc
there is no way of knowing many things about the outside world. For example,
there is no function in C that returns a hash map to all the variables that have
been stack-allocated. But we can get by without this, by realizing two important
facts:</p>

<p>Firstly (gosh I say that a lot), in C, you can <i>attempt</i> to access any
memory location you want. There is no chunk of memory that for some reason the
compiler can access but has an address that cannot be expressed as an integer 
and then casted to a pointer. It isn't possible. If memory is used in a C
program, it can be accessed by the program. This is a confusing notion for 
programmers unfamiliar to C, as many languages provide restricted access to
virtual memory addresses. C does not.</p> 

<p>Secondly, all variables are stored somewhere in memory. Well duh. But what
that means is that if we know generally where the variables are stored, we can 
look through that memory and find all the possible values of every variable. 
Additionally, because memory access is generally only word-aligned, we only need
to look through every word in the memory regions.</p> 

<p>Local variables can also be stored in registers, but we won't worry about 
this because registers and usually dedicated to local variables, and by the time
our function is called they'll probably be saved on the stack anyway</p>

<p>Now we have a strategy for the marking phase of our collector: look through a
bunch of memory regions and see if there is any memory that looks like it 
references something in the used list. Writing a function to do that is pretty
clear cut:</p>

<pre>#define UNTAG(p) (((unsigned int) (p)) &amp; 0xfffffffc)

/*
 * Scan a region of memory and mark any items in the used list appropriately.
 * Both arguments should be word aligned.
 */
static void
mark_from_region(unsigned int *sp, unsigned int *end)
{
    header_t *bp;

    for (; sp &lt; end; sp++) {
        unsigned int v = *sp;
        bp = usedp;
        do {
            if (bp + 1 &lt;= v &amp;&amp;
                bp + 1 + bp-&gt;size &gt; v) {
                    bp-&gt;next = ((unsigned int) bp-&gt;next) | 1;
                    break;
            }
        } while ((bp = UNTAG(bp-&gt;next)) != usedp);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>To ensure we only use two words in the header we use a technique here called
tagged pointers. Since our next pointers will be word aligned, a few of the
least significant bits will always be zero. Thus, we mark the least significant
bit of the next pointer to indicate that the current block (not the one pointed
to by next!) has been marked.</p>

<p>Now we can scan memory regions, but which memory regions should we look
through? There are several</p>

<ol>
  <li>The BSS (uninitialized data segment) and the initialized data segment. 
These contain all the global and static variables in the program. Thus, they 
could reference something in our heap.</li>
  <li>The used chunks. Of course, if the user allocates a pointer to another
allocated chunk, we don't want to free the pointed-to chunk.</li>
  <li>The stack. Since the stack contains all the local variables, this is 
arguably the most important place to look.</li>
</ol>

<p>But now there's the problem of knowing where these memory regions start and
end. We already know where the used chunks are, but the other regions are 
trickier.</p>

<p>We already know everything about the heap, so writing a mark_from_heap 
function is trivial:</p>

<pre>/*
 * Scan the marked blocks for references to other unmarked blocks.
 */
static void
mark_from_heap(void)
{
    unsigned int *vp;
    header_t *bp, *up;

    for (bp = UNTAG(usedp-&gt;next); bp != usedp; bp = UNTAG(bp-&gt;next)) {
        if (!((unsigned int)bp-&gt;next &amp; 1))
            continue;
        for (vp = (unsigned int *)(bp + 1);
             vp &lt; (bp + bp-&gt;size + 1);
             vp++) {
            unsigned int v = *vp;
            up = UNTAG(bp-&gt;next);
            do {
                if (up != bp &amp;&amp;
                    up + 1 &lt;= v &amp;&amp;
                    up + 1 + up-&gt;size &gt; v) {
                    up-&gt;next = ((unsigned int) up-&gt;next) | 1;
                    break;
                }
            } while ((up = UNTAG(up-&gt;next)) != bp);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Fortunately for the BSS and initialized data segments, most modern Unix 
linkers export the etext and end symbols. The address of the etext symbol is the
start of the initialized data segment (the last address past the text segment,
which contains the program's machine code), and the address of the end symbol is
the start of the heap. Thus, the BSS and initialized data segment are located 
in between &amp;etext and &amp;end. This is simple enough, but not platform 
independent.</p>

<p>The stack is a little harder. The top of the stack is super simple to find 
using a little bit of inline assembly, as it is stored in the %esp register.
However, we'll be using the %ebp register as it ignores a few local 
variables.</p>

<p>Finding the very bottom of the stack (where the stack began) involves some 
trickery. Kernels tend to randomize the starting point of the stack for security
reasons, so we can't hard code an address. To be honest, I'm not an expert on 
finding the bottom of the stack, but I have a few rather poor ideas on how you 
can make an accurate. One possible way is you could scan the call stack for the 
env pointer, which would be passed as an argument to main. Another way would be
to start at the top of the stack and read every subsequent address greater and
handling the inexorible SIGSEGV. But we're not going to do it either way. 
Instead, we're going to exploit the fact that linux puts the bottom of the stack
in a string in a file in the process's entry in the proc directory (phew!). This
sounds silly and terribly indirect. Fortunately, I don't feel ridiculous for
doing doing it because it's literally <i>the exact same thing Boehm GC does to
find the bottom of the stack!</i></p>

<p>Now we can make ourselves a little init function. In it, we open the proc 
file on ourselves and find the bottom of the stack. This is the 28th value 
printed so we discard the first 27. Boehm GC differs from us in that they only
use sys calls to do the file reading in order to avoid the stdlib from using the
heap, but we don't really care.</p>

<pre>/*
 * Find the absolute bottom of the stack and set stuff up.
 */
void
GC_init(void)
{
    static int initted;
    FILE *statfp;

    if (initted)
        return;

    initted = 1;

    statfp = fopen("/proc/self/stat", "r");
    assert(statfp != NULL);
    fscanf(statfp,
           "%*d %*s %*c %*d %*d %*d %*d %*d %*u "
           "%*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*ld %*ld "
           "%*ld %*ld %*ld %*ld %*llu %*lu %*ld "
           "%*lu %*lu %*lu %lu", &amp;stack_bottom);
    fclose(statfp);

    usedp = NULL;
    base.next = freep = &amp;base;
    base.size = 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Now we know the location of every memory region we would need to scan, and 
thus, we can finally write our explicitly-called collection function:</p>

<pre>/*
 * Mark blocks of memory in use and free the ones not in use.
 */
void
GC_collect(void)
{
    header_t *p, *prevp, *tp;
    unsigned long stack_top;
    extern char end, etext; /* Provided by the linker. */

    if (usedp == NULL)
        return;
	
    /* Scan the BSS and initialized data segments. */
    mark_from_region(&amp;etext, &amp;end);

    /* Scan the stack. */
    asm volatile ("movl	%%ebp, %0" : "=r" (stack_top));
    mark_from_region(stack_top, stack_bottom);

    /* Mark from the heap. */
    mark_from_heap();

    /* And now we collect! */
    for (prevp = usedp, p = UNTAG(usedp-&gt;next);; prevp = p, p = UNTAG(p-&gt;next)) {
    next_chunk:
        if (!((unsigned int)p-&gt;next &amp; 1)) {
            /*
             * The chunk hasn't been marked. Thus, it must be set free. 
             */
            tp = p;
            p = UNTAG(p-&gt;next);
            add_to_free_list(tp);

            if (usedp == tp) { 
                usedp = NULL;
                break;
            }

            prevp-&gt;next = (unsigned int)p | ((unsigned int) prevp-&gt;next &amp; 1);
            goto next_chunk;
        }
        p-&gt;next = ((unsigned int) p-&gt;next) &amp; ~1;
        if (p == usedp)
            break;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>And that, my friends, is all there is. One simple garbage collector written
in C and for C. This code isn't complete in itself, it needs a few little tweaks
here in there to get it working, but most of the code mostly holds up on its
own.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>From elementary school through half of high school, I played drums. Every
Wednesday at around 4:30 pm I had a drum lesson from a teacher who was quite
good.</p>

<p>Whenever I was having trouble learning a new groove or beat or whatever, 
he would always give me the same diagnosis: I was trying to do everything at 
once. I looked at the sheet of music, and I simply tried to play with all my
hands. But I couldn't. And the reason why is because I didn't know how to play
the groove yet, and simply trying to play the groove wasn't how I was going to
learn.</p>

<p>So my teacher would enlighten me as to how I could learn: don't try playing
everything at once. Learn to play the high-hat part with your right hand. Once
you've got that down, learn to play the snare with your left. Do the same with
the bass, the tom-toms, and whatever other parts there are. When you have all
the individual parts down, slowly begin to add them together. Add them together
in pairs, then in threes, and eventually you'll be able to play the entire 
thing</p>

<p>I never got good at drums, but I did take these lessons to heart in my
programming. It's really hard to just start to type out an entire program. The
only algorithm you need to write code is divide and conquer. Write the function
to allocate memory. Then, write the function to look through memory. Then,
write the function that cleans up memory. Finally, add them all together.</p>

<p>As soon as you get past this barrier as a programmer, nothing practical 
becomes ``hard''. You may not understand an algorithm, but anyone can understand
an algorithm with enough time, paper, and the right book. If a project seems
daunting, break it up into its individual parts. You may not know how to write
an interpreter, but you sure as hell can write a parser. Find out what else you
need to add, and do it.</p>
